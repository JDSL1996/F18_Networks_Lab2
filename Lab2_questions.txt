1) IP Source: 192.168.1.102, Source TCP Port: 1161
2) IP Destination: 128.119.245.12, Sending/receiving Source Port: 80

3)IP Source: 10.200.48.49, Source TCP Port: 62069

4) Sequence Number: 0 , The Flags Segment identifies it as a SYN segment

5) Sequence Number: 0 , {{Couldn't find a field called acknowledgement, could find acknowledgement number}} Acknowledgement Number: 1 , The Acknowledgement Number is relative to the sequence number of the GET request, The Flags Segment identifies it as a SYN ACK segment

6) Sequence Number: 164041

7) {{Very Confused D:}}

8) {{Based on 7}}

9) {{Can not find in packet}}

10) No, You can check the sequence numbers and ack numbers to check for duplicates, you can also use tcp.analysis.retransmission in wireshark to find this too.

11) {{Assumption based on 13 logic}} During the slow start it is acking after every request, but later its acking after every 6

12) 164090/5.297257= 30,976.41 bytes/second.  This was calculated by checking the HTTP post command timestamps and the length of the TCP segments that were reassmbled

13) We can see the slow start starting from 0-.02648 seconds where the cwnd is at 1 MSS.  It seems that the MSS caps at 6 and goes from 2 to 6 instead of 2-4-8 and onward.
